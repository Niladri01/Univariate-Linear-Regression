# Univariate-Linear-Regression

#FOR MANUPULATION  import numpy as np
                   import pandas as pd

#FOR VISUALIZATION import seaborn as sns 
                   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
                   plt.style.use('ggplot')
                   %matplotlib inline
                  
Name of the dataset : bike_sharing_data.txt

Size of the dataset : (97, 2)

The aim of this project was to implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch, perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python and to create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib

Tasks:

    Loading the data

    Quick Visualization

    Compute the cost

    Gradient Descent

    Plotting the convergence

    Training data with linear regression fit

    Inference using the optimized theta values

For Data Visualization, I used:

scatter plot

# Univariate-Linear-Regression

*Aim:* The aim of this project was to implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch, perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python and to create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib

## Theoretical Overview

*Univariate Linear Regression:* Univariate is a statistics term describing a type of data having only one attribute or a variable. Therefore, Univariate Linear Regression is a type of *supervised machine learning* algorithm which determines relationship between one independent and one dependent variable. 

## For Manipulation  
       import numpy as np
       import pandas as pd

## For Visualization
       import seaborn as sns 
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
       plt.style.use('ggplot')
       %matplotlib inline
                  
## Name of the dataset : 
       bike_sharing_data.txt

## Size of the dataset : 
       (97, 2)

## Tasks:
       Loading the data
       Quick Visualization
       Compute the cost
       Gradient Descent
       Plotting the convergence
       Training data with linear regression fit
       Inference using the optimized theta values

## For Data Visualization, I used:
       scatter plot
